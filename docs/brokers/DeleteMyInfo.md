# DeleteMyInfo

DeleteMyInfo states that it removes your personal information from "all major data brokers" and any other websites where your information is unauthorizedly listed. They do not provide an explicit, exhaustive list of every data broker they cover, but generally target a wide range of data brokers, including:

*   **People search websites:** Examples include MyLife.com, Whitepages.com, BeenVerified.com, Spokeo.com, Intelius, Nuwber, PeekYou, and TruthFinder.
*   **Marketing data brokers:** Companies that collect data for targeted advertising and consumer profiling.
*   **Risk mitigation data brokers:** Brokers that gather information for purposes like background checks.
*   **Credit reporting agencies:** Companies like Equifax, Experian, TransUnion, and Innovis also act as data brokers by collecting and selling financial information.

DeleteMyInfo uses a mix of automated scans and manual verification to remove personal information from all known data brokers, people-search websites, and platforms.
