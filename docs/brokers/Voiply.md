# Voiply

Voiply is primarily a phone service provider and states in its Privacy Policy that it "do[es] not sell your personal data." It does not act as a data broker, nor does it provide a service for removing personal information from data brokers.

While Voiply may share data with various entities for operational purposes (telecommunications providers, hosting, analytics, CRM vendors, marketing partners, legal/regulatory entities, and public directories if requested by the user), it is not a data broker removal service. Therefore, there is no list of data brokers that Voiply handles for removal.
