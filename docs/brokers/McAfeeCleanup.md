# McAfee Cleanup

McAfee offers a "Personal Data Cleanup" feature as part of its security products. This feature helps users identify and remove their personal information from data broker sites. It scans over 175 data broker databases to identify and assist in removing personal details.

McAfee's service focuses on a selection of data brokers, particularly the "riskiest" ones, and scans people search sites in the US, UK, Canada, and Australia. While a publicly accessible, exhaustive list of all data brokers it covers is not provided, some prominent examples mentioned include:

*   Acxiom
*   Epsilon
*   Oracle
*   Equifax
*   Experian
*   People-search sites like PeekYou, Spokeo, and Whitepages.

McAfee notifies users which sites are selling their data and recommends actions for removal. Users can either manually remove their data or, with the "full service" option, McAfee will contact the data broker sites on their behalf to request removal. The full service also includes quarterly scans and tracking of data removal progress.
