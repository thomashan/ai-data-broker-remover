# PurePrivacy

PurePrivacy is a service designed to help users remove their personal information from data brokers. While PurePrivacy states that it can remove data from over 200 data brokers, a specific, comprehensive list of these brokers is not publicly available.

The service works by identifying data brokers that have access to your information and then sending requests on your behalf to remove that data, leveraging privacy laws like GDPR and CCPA.
