# Kanary

Kanary is a personal data removal service that helps users remove their personal information from data broker websites. Kanary publicly lists the data brokers and other sites it monitors, covering over 300 data brokers and privacy-damaging sites. It automates the opt-out process for approximately 209 to 260 of these sites. For other sites, particularly those requiring high levels of identity verification, Kanary provides templates and guides for users to submit removal requests themselves. Many of the data brokers covered by Kanary are "people search sites."

A comprehensive list of the data brokers Kanary covers is typically available within a user's dashboard after signing up for their service.
