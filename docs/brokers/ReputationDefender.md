ReputationDefender states that they maintain a "rolling list of the active people-search sites for our removal services, adding and removing sites as appropriate." They do not publicly provide this full list, but mention that there are "dozens" of such sites and that it's "basically impossible" to find every data broker site selling personal information because there are "hundreds" of them, many of which "intentionally fly under the radar."

ReputationDefender and Reputation.ca (a related entity) identify some of the largest data brokers in America, including:

*   Acxiom LLC
*   Experian LLC
*   Epsilon Data Management LLC
*   Oracle America, Inc.

These data brokers collect and sell various types of personal data, such as names, addresses, shopping habits, political contributions, real estate activities, and even religious views. They gather this information from public records, social media, and marketing databases.
