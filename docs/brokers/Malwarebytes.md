Malwarebytes offers a "Personal Data Remover" product designed to help users remove their personal information from data broker databases and people search sites. This service scans over 175 data broker databases to identify and assist in removing personal details.

While Malwarebytes does not publicly provide a comprehensive list of all the data brokers it scans, it has mentioned prominent examples of third-party data brokers, including:

*   Experian
*   Equifax
*   Acxiom
*   Epsilon

Malwarebytes emphasizes that it is not a data broker itself and does not sell or rent personal information to third parties. Their Personal Data Remover aims to empower users to take back control of their privacy by facilitating the removal of their data from these sites.
