Got it — here's your **enhanced self-organizing Data Broker Discovery & Monitoring Agent** with a **self-organizing agent network approach** that now includes:

* `regulations` → array instead of single string
* `aliases` → for tracking multiple known domains
* `notes` → for any extra context

## **Self-Organizing Data Broker Discovery & Monitoring Agent**

### **1) Goal**

Continuously discover, categorize, and monitor data brokers across the web using a self-organizing network of specialized agents, keeping structured records for easy opt-out tracking, regulatory awareness, and historical changes.

---

### **2) Continuous Search Scope**

The agent network should:

* Continuously search for **all types of data brokers**:
    * People search websites
    * Marketing data brokers
    * Risk mitigation data brokers
    * Credit reporting agencies
    * Background check websites
    * Marketing research agencies
    * Large data aggregators
    * Recruitment data brokers
    * Financial information brokers
    * Health information data brokers
    * Other Data Brokers
    * Unexpected Data Brokers
* Monitor company news, press releases, industry blogs, privacy forums, Reddit, LinkedIn, and regulatory registers.
* Detect and log:
    * New companies entering the data broker market
    * Name/domain changes
    * New or updated opt-out URLs

---

### **3) Self-Organizing Agent Network Architecture**

The system implements a **self-organizing network of agents** that dynamically form collaborations based on task requirements and resource availability:

#### **Agent Types**
* **Discovery Agents**: Specialize in finding new data brokers through various sources
* **Deduplication Agents**: Handle identification and merging of duplicate broker entries
* **Crawling Agents**: Specialize in extracting detailed information from broker websites
* **Monitoring Agents**: Continuously check broker sites for changes in opt-out links
* **Classification Agents**: Categorize brokers and update classifications based on new information
* **Coordination Agents**: Facilitate communication and collaboration between specialized agents

#### **Dynamic Collaboration**
* Agents dynamically form task-specific collaborations based on workload and expertise
* Resource-aware task distribution ensures optimal utilization of local computing resources
* Emergent behavior allows the network to discover efficient processing patterns over time
* Fault-tolerant design ensures system resilience even when individual agents fail

#### **Agent Communication & Coordination**
* Agents communicate through **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** for state sharing and task coordination
* Shared memory structures maintain global state while allowing local decision-making
* Asynchronous messaging enables scalable communication without blocking operations
* Adaptive protocols allow agents to modify communication patterns based on network conditions

### **4) Output Data Model**

```json
{
  "name": "Data Broker Name",
  "url": "https://example.com",
  "category": "People search websites",
  "description": "Short summary of the broker's services.",
  "country": "US",
  "regulations": [
    "GDPR"
  ],
  "opt_out_url": "https://example.com/opt-out",
  "created_timestamp": "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS",
  "updated_timestamp": "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS",
  "last_crawled_timestamp": "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS",
  "last_categorised_timestamp": "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS",
  "last_monitored_status": "Success",
  "last_monitored_message": "No opt-out links found.",
  "last_monitored_source": "Search result or reference link",

  "source": "Search result or reference link",
  "aliases": [
    "example.com",
    "example.org",
    "example.net"
  ],
  "notes": "Additional information about the broker."
}
```

### **5) Agent Loop Logic**

**Loop Trigger**: Continuously search for new search results by comparing previous results with current results.

#### **Step 1 — Discovery**

* Query multiple sources:
    * Search engines (Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo, Brave)
    * Regulatory lists (FTC, GDPR DPAs, CCPA registries)
    * Industry news & press releases
    * Social media and forums
* Extract:
    * Name
    * URL
    * Description
    * Opt-out URLs if found
    * Country (from site or WHOIS)
    * Category (classification engine)
    * Regulations (list of applicable)
    * Aliases (alternate domains, old names)

#### **Step 2 — Deduplication**

* Check if **name**, **url**, or **aliases** match an existing entry.
* If new → set `created_timestamp` to now.
* If existing → update `updated_timestamp` and overwrite changed fields.

#### **Step 3 — Crawling & Classification**

* Crawl broker site for:
    * Privacy policy
    * "Opt-out", "Do not sell", "Delete my data" links
    * Company info and alternate domains
* Update:
    * `last_crawled_timestamp` → now
    * `last_categorised_timestamp` → if category changes

#### **Step 4 — Monitoring & Status Update**

* For each broker record:
    * Visit site / opt-out page
    * Record:
        * `last_monitored_status` → `"Success"` or `"Error"`
        * `last_monitored_message` → short summary of result
        * `last_monitored_source` → `"Direct crawl"` or `"Search result"`
        * `last_monitored_timestamp` → now
        * `last_monitored_duration` → crawl time in HH\:MM\:SS

### **6) Self-Organization Mechanisms**

#### **Adaptive Resource Management**
* Agents monitor local system resources (CPU, memory, network) and adapt their behavior accordingly
* Dynamic scaling of agent instances based on workload demands
* Load balancing across available computing resources
* Energy-efficient operation modes for battery-powered devices

#### **Emergent Behavior Patterns**
* Agents learn from historical performance data to optimize task allocation
* Network topology evolves based on successful collaboration patterns
* Collective decision-making for complex tasks that require multiple agent types
* Self-optimization of communication protocols based on network performance

#### **Resilience & Fault Tolerance**
* Automatic failover when agents become unresponsive
* Redundant processing for critical tasks
* Graceful degradation when system resources are constrained
* Self-healing mechanisms to restore normal operation after failures

---

### **7) Local LLM & MCP Integration**

#### **Local LLM Usage**
* All AI processing runs on locally-hosted LLMs (e.g., Llama3 via Ollama)
* Context-aware prompt optimization for different agent types
* Efficient token usage to minimize computational overhead
* Offline operation capabilities with no external API dependencies

#### **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**
* State persistence between agent interactions
* Context sharing for collaborative decision-making
* Memory management to prevent resource exhaustion
* Version control for shared knowledge bases

---

### **8) Persistence Rules**

* Save in data in either JSON or persistent DB depending on app mode.
* Maintain backups and historical diffs.
* Keep old URLs in `aliases` rather than deleting.

---

### **9) KPIs**

* New brokers per week
* Updated brokers per week
* Median monitoring cycle time
* % with valid opt-out URL
* Network efficiency metrics (agent collaboration success rate)
* Resource utilization statistics

---

### **10) Complexity Management**

* Modular design allows for incremental system enhancements
* Predictable behavior patterns through defined agent interaction protocols
* Comprehensive testing framework for validating agent network behavior
* Monitoring and observability tools for debugging emergent behaviors
* Documentation of common collaboration patterns for system understanding
