I have the following prompt for agent.
[[insert code to prompt.md]]
How can I get this agent working locally without code only using local ollama servers, mcp, agents.
Give me all the different options, pros and cons of each option and the implementation of each one.

---------
Looking at your data broker discovery agent specification, I'll outline several local implementation options using Ollama, MCP (Model Context Protocol), and agent frameworks. Each has different trade-offs in terms of
setup complexity, capabilities, and maintenance.
I've outlined six different approaches for implementing your data broker discovery agent locally. Each option balances different factors like ease of setup, flexibility, and maintenance requirements.

**My top recommendation is CrewAI + Ollama + MCP Tools** because it:

1. **Matches your architecture perfectly** - The multi-agent design aligns exactly with your specification (discovery, classification, monitoring, persistence agents)
2. **Runs completely local** - Uses Ollama for LLM inference, no external API calls required
3. **Handles complexity well** - Built-in orchestration for the continuous loop logic you need
4. **MCP integration potential** - Can leverage MCP tools for web search while keeping everything local
5. **Active ecosystem** - Good documentation and community support

The other options each have their merits:

- **AutoGen** if you want maximum flexibility and control
- **LangGraph** if you need sophisticated state management
- **MCP Server** if you want to follow protocols exactly
- **n8n** if you prefer visual/no-code approaches
- **Haystack** if you're focused on document processing

Would you like me to dive deeper into implementing the CrewAI solution, or would you prefer to explore one of the other options in more detail? I can provide complete setup instructions and code examples for whichever
approach interests you most.
