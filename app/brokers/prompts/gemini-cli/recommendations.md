# Request

You are an expert level software engineer who always write tests first and always write code that passes the tests following strict TDD principles.
You are working on a project that requires you to write code in a test-driven development (TDD) style.
You will be given a task to implement a feature or fix a bug, and you must write a test for it first.
You will then implement the code to make the test pass, following the TDD principles.
You will not write any code that does not have a corresponding test.
If you make a code change write a test first.
First make the tests fail and make the code change which makes the tests to pass.

I want you to give me some recommendations on how to get the following agent working locally without code only using local ollama servers, mcp, agents.
Give me all the different options, pros and cons of each option and the implementation of each one.
Don't make any code changes, only recommendations.

# Response

âœ¦ Of course. Based on the information in app/brokers/prompts/claude/local-agent-options.md, here are the different options for running a local agent with Ollama, with their pros and cons.

Option 1: CrewAI + Ollama (Recommended)

This approach uses the CrewAI framework to orchestrate agents that use local models served by Ollama.

* Pros:
    * Aligns with your goals: The multi-agent design of CrewAI is a good match for complex tasks.
    * Local Control: Runs entirely on your machine.
    * Extensible: Easy to add new agents and capabilities.
    * Active Community: Benefits from active development and good documentation.
* Cons:
    * Requires Python: You need to set up a Python environment and write code.
    * Resource Intensive: Running multiple agents can be demanding on your local machine.

Option 2: AutoGen + Ollama

This option uses Microsoft's AutoGen framework, which is designed for creating conversational agents.

* Pros:
    * Mature Framework: Well-established with good support for local LLMs.
    * Flexible: Supports complex, conversation-based interactions between agents.
    * Good Debugging: Offers good tools for debugging and logging.
* Cons:
    * Complex Orchestration: Can be difficult to manage long-running tasks.
    * Memory Management: Can be challenging to manage memory usage effectively.

Option 3: LangGraph + Ollama

This uses LangChain's LangGraph library to build agent workflows as a graph.

* Pros:
    * State Management: Excellent for long-running processes that require state to be maintained.
    * Visual Workflows: The graph-based structure can make complex workflows easier to understand.
    * Conditional Logic: Supports complex branching and conditional logic in your agent's execution.
* Cons:
    * Steep Learning Curve: Requires knowledge of the LangChain ecosystem.
    * Can be Overkill: Might be too complex for simpler agent workflows.

Option 4: Custom MCP Server

This involves building a custom server that implements the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and integrates with local tools and Ollama.

* Pros:
    * Protocol-Compliant: Adheres to the MCP standard, making it interoperable with other MCP-compatible tools.
    * Separation of Concerns: Cleanly separates the agent's logic from the client.
* Cons:
    * High Complexity: Requires a deep understanding of the MCP protocol.
    * Limited Client Options: There are not many MCP clients available.

Option 5: n8n Workflow + Ollama

This is a low-code/no-code option that uses the n8n workflow automation tool.

* Pros:
    * Visual Workflow Builder: Allows you to create agent workflows visually.
    * Built-in Scheduling: Comes with tools for scheduling and monitoring your workflows.
    * Good for Non-Programmers: Accessible to users who are not comfortable with coding.
* Cons:
    * Limited Complexity: Not well-suited for highly complex or custom logic.
    * Less Flexible: Less flexible than code-based solutions.

Option 6: Haystack Pipelines + Ollama

This option uses the Haystack framework by Deepset to build agentic pipelines.

* Pros:
    * Excellent for Document Processing: Well-suited for tasks that involve search and retrieval from documents.
    * Modular: Pipelines are built from modular components that can be easily reused.
* Cons:
    * Primarily for Search/QA: Less suited for general-purpose agentic tasks.
    * Can be Overkill: Might be too complex for simple web-scraping or data-processing tasks.

I can elaborate on any of these options if you'd like.'
